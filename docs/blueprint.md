## Style Guidelines:

- Header and Footer Background: #F1EEE4 for a soft, muted backdrop.
- Main Body/Section Backgrounds: #FBF9F4, a lighter shade for content display.
- Primary color: A muted rose (#D88A8A) which evokes the subtle elegance of a boutique brand, yet avoids the cliched intensity of stronger reds and pinks.
- Accent color: A warm sepia (#A67351), evoking the same feeling, but different enough in saturation and brightness to provide the contrast necessary for highlights and call-to-action buttons.
- Body font: 'Alegreya', a serif typeface, offering an intellectual yet contemporary feel appropriate for small or long blocks of text.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' a stylish sans-serif typeface that, due to its fashion and art associations, can work with the body copy.
- Simple line icons for navigation and actions, ensuring clarity and a modern aesthetic.
- Clean, minimal layout with ample white space to create a premium and uncluttered feel.
- Subtle transitions and animations for banner sliders and category scrolling, providing a smooth user experience.
